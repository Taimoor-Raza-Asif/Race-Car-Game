## Key Features:

- **Manual and Automatic Modes:** Choose between manual control and automatic navigation.
- **Graph-Based Maze:** The track is represented as a graph for efficient navigation and obstacle detection.
- **Power-Ups:** Strategically placed boosts to enhance your score.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Navigate carefully to avoid collisions and maintain your score.
- **Dynamic Difficulty Levels:** Select from various difficulty settings to alter gameplay.
- **High Scores:** Keep track of top players and their scores.
- **Sound Effects:** Immerse yourself in the game with navigation and event sounds.


## Project Structure

- **main.cpp:** The main file containing the game's entry point.
- **CarGame.h and CarGame.cpp:** Class definition and implementation for the game logic.
- **Graph.h and Graph.cpp:** Graph class for representing the track.
- **Menu.h and Menu.cpp:** Header file and implementation for menu-related functions.
- **Map.h and Map.cpp:** Class for managing the map, obstacles, and power-ups.


## How to Play:
1. Launch the game.
2. Navigate the main menu to choose the game mode (Manual or Automatic).
3. In manual mode, control the car using arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).
4. Collect power-ups to increase your score.
5. Avoid hitting obstacles to prevent score reduction.
6. Decide whether to play the next level after completing a level.


## Compilation and Execution:
- Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed.
- Compile the code using the compiler's command (e.g., `g++ main.cpp -o RaceCarGame`).
- Run the executable (`RaceCarGame`) to start the game.


## Controls
- Use arrow keys for navigation in manual mode.
- Enter 'o' for sound ON, 'f' for sound OFF, and 'b' to go back in the sound options.


## Difficulty Selection
Choose the desired difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard) in the options menu.


## Exiting the Game
Select 'Quit' from the main menu to exit the game.


## High Scores
View top scores by selecting 'High Score' from the main menu.
